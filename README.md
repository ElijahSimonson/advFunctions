# Advanced Functions

Advanced Functions is an In-Development mod for Minecraft.

It will focus on implementing interfaces between many of the currently active mods.

All development and changes will be implemented on develop branch, before being pushed to master for release version.

Feel free to fork and make suggestions for the mod using the Issue Tracker (Basic minecraft forge knowledge recommended). 

If you wish to contact me directly I am highly active on Discord: discord.gg/JrJCRBz
